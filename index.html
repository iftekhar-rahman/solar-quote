                        <p>We use your data (described above) in the following ways.</p>
                        
                        <h4>TO CONNECT YOU WITH RELEVANT SERVICE PROVIDERS</h4>
                        <p>As explained above, if you submit our webform, we’ll pass your request to one or more relevant Service Providers (named on the consent statement). We will do this in a secure way. For example, using HTTP Secure (HTTPS), which means the data is encrypted. The Service Providers then contact you directly with your quotes. They may contact you by telephone, text/SMS or email.</p>
                        <p>Before we pass your request to any Service Providers, our service may involve an element of automated decision-making. Our technology platform may automatically assess your Product requirements and pass your request to such Service Providers that would like to receive requests for Quotes at the time your request is made.</p>
                        <p>We store IP addresses in order to stop unwanted traffic (i.e. spam) to our site. For example, if we become aware that spam is coming from a particular IP address (i.e. computer or location), we can block that IP address. From time to time, we also share IP addresses with Service Providers to enable Service Providers to verify that requests for Quotes have come from a particular country.</p>
                        <p>You will always be given an opportunity to opt out of such messages before we send them, and we will not send such messages if you have opted out.</p>
                        
                        <h4>RECEIVING DATA FROM SERVICE PROVIDERS</h4>
                        <p>From time to time, Service Providers may return data to us. They may do this if they have a query regarding a request for Quotes that we have sent to them in order to enable us to resolve the query. They may also return data to us, together with confirmation on whether or not a product has been purchased, in order to enable us to improve our marketing. We may also use such data to create custom and lookalike/similar audiences, as explained above.</p>
                        
                        <h4>WORKING WITH SUPPLIERS</h4>
                        <p>We work with a number of suppliers, who process data on our behalf. These include, email service providers and telephone number validation services. We have appropriate contracts in place with such suppliers to ensure the protection and confidentiality of data.</p>
                        
                        <h4>COOKIES</h4>

                        <h4>STORING YOUR DATA</h4>
                        <p>We have a data retention policy, which clearly sets out how long we keep data for, and for what reasons.</p>
                        <p>We will keep your data only for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purpose/s for which it was collected in the first place, i.e. as set out in this notice.</p>
                        <p>For example:</p>

                            <li>We will keep your request for Quotes for 6 months after you make the request to enable us to resolve any queries from Service Providers, should they arise.</li>
                            <li>If you haven’t opted out of receiving marketing from us, we will keep your details, and send you emails, until such time as you don’t engage with our emails for a period of 6 consecutive months.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Following the periods set out above, we will not use the data, save that we will hash/anonymise the same, and retain it for a further 3 years for compliance purposes.</p>
                        
                        <h4>LEGAL GROUNDS</h4>
